You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and an integer k.

The K-or of nums is a non-negative integer that satisfies the following:

The ith bit is set in the K-or if and only if there are at least k elements of nums in which bit i is set.
Return the K-or of nums.

Note that a bit i is set in x if (2i AND x) == 2i, where AND is the bitwise AND operator.
